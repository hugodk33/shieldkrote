/* ============================================================
   Which hat am I wearing?

   There used to be only one piece of identity — the seat, meaning
   "the PC I am playing". That made it impossible to be the narrator
   while a player seat was saved: every narrator route read the seat,
   treated you as that player and redirected you to the player
   console.

   Now the side is explicit and separate from the seat:

     side = "gm"      → you are the narrator; full catalog, no redirect
     side = "player"  → you are playing; filtered, and narrator routes
                        hand you over to the player console

   The narrator side is the default, and picking a player side also
   records WHICH character you picked (`asCharacter`), so the narrator
   can preview the table through any PC's eyes — including their own,
   which a plain user id could never express.

   Still not auth. These are three cookies any client can write.
