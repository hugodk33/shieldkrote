/* ============================================================
   Perspective Switch — dev tool that simulates an OAuth seat.
   No real auth exists; identity is a URL + a localStorage seat
   (the player USER seated at a table). This pill flips between
   the narrator (GM) perspective and the player perspective,
   remembering who you are:

     npm run dev  →  visit any page, click the pill bottom-right.

   Landing rules, switching INTO the player side:
     · /character/<id>   → /player/character/<id>  (your own console,
                            sheet open by default — your sheet).
     · /table/<id>/...   → /player/character/<your seat>  (console
                            open, table resources accessible from there).
     · anything else     → /player.

   Which hat is on is stored explicitly (lib/side.ts) instead of being
   guessed from the seat. Guessing is what used to break: adopting a player
   seat wrote a player id into the actor cookie, and every narrator route
   then read that cookie, decided "that is a player" and redirected here.
   Switching back has to actually undo it, not just write a `vkrpg.role`
   key that nothing ever read.
